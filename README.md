### âœ¨ Hi there, I'm Cristina âœ¨  ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am currently a [PhD candidate with the Nottingham Geospatial Institute, University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ngi/meet-the-team/cristina.vrinceanu) working on a thesis that aims at assess `offshore oil pollution seep-detection` in the Black Sea basin using `Synthetic Aperture Radar Earth Observation` data using ML and open-source programmatic approaches. 
<br> <i> Background in: Ocean Surface Processes, Petroleum Geoscience, Synthetic Aperture Radar, Earth Observaton Marine Products, Algorithm Development, Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Earth Observation </i></br>

ðŸ”­ Separately, I hold a position as a [Research Fellow with the Rights Lab Beacon, University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/beacons-of-excellence/rights-lab/our-team/cristina-vrinceanu/index.aspx) where I develop `geospatial` and `Earth Observation` based algorithms to detect patterns associated with `modern slavery` across global regions.
<br> <i> Background in: Geospatial and Earth Observation data analysis and mapping, Algorithm development, Product development, Geospatial Systems design, Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Geospatial Big Data, Modern Slavery and Humanitarian </i></br>

ðŸ‘¯ My research interests include Earth Observation/Remote Sensing,  Geographic Information Science (GIS), Big Data, Machine Learning/AI and cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Google Earth Engine, Planetary Computer) to study and build products covering the intersection between social and environmental global issues. I am particularily interested in how we can use these technologies for solving challenges in marginalised or underserved communities affected by current global challenges. 

ðŸ‘¯ I am very keen on all things `open` and the power of `foss4g` and I occasionally volunteer with [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/) globally and in the UK and with [geo-spatial.org](https://geo-spatial.org/) in Romania. I'm also very happy to share my knowledge and expertise and love helping people learn and apply geospatial data and tools.
